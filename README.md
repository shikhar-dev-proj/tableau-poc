# TableauPoc

Purpose of this codebase is to provide an initial setup for Angular integration with Tableau to embed cool visualizations into your web application.
The index.html (entry point) consists of 2 script tags for tableau, one is my personal workbook in Tableau public and another is a third party workbook link.
Checkout both the visualizations by running the application.
